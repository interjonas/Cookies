# Cookies and Caching
This was given as an assigned project where it was required we utilize formerly designed web services, specifically RESTful services and integrate them into a custom browser webpage. One of the web services I used was one designed for printing out a continent's population upon a given user input. The web service was a RESTful web service and was inkvoked using the URL and passing the parameter string through the URL as well. Once the result is returned from the web service the cookie is designed to remember your last input into the text field as well as the last result returned. The cookie is designed to stay within the browser memory for six months before it resets and appears blank during start up. The caching implemented is more basic than the cookie implementation. The caching simply saves the date and time of the last time a user used one of the web services on the webpage and then prints out the cached information. This project's overall goal was to show how modern web services and online products operate by utilizing one of the most frequent tools of saving user prefrances and actions by implementing cookies and caches.
